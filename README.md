Local Laws 97 and 95 propose severe and growing penalties for electricity production via cogeneration in hospitals. It's not self-evident that this is an effective approach to reducing NYC carbon emissions. This project determines the combined efficiency of cogeneration and boilers in the Long Island Jewish Medical Center while accounting for complex factors that regulators disregard.

By comparing emissions produced by Long Island Jewish Medical Center with their grid supplying power plant counterparts, an abundantly clear conclusion supports the economic and enviornmental viability of cogeneration plants at present. This conclusion calls for more research reguarding how Local Laws 95 and 97 can most productively limit regional emmisions, particularly in previously overlooked energy prosumers.
